An Adapter is the part of BHoM that enables connection to and from external software.

The Adapter is built on top of the other two main repos: [the oM](/BH.oM-%E2%80%90-Define-New-Objects) and [the Engine](/BH.Engine-%E2%80%90-Create-New-Algorithms).

Detailed information on how to develop and implement the different parts of an adapter are available in the _[introduction to the BHoM_Adapter](/Introduction-to-the-BHoM_Adapter)_ and following pages. 

This guide will focus on getting you started for development in less than 10 minutes! üöÄ
