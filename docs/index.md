# Welcome to BHoM Wiki!

## So - what exactly is the BHoM?

The **BHoM** (**Buildings and Habitats object Model**) is a collaborative computational development project for the built environment. It is a collective effort to share code and standardise the data that we use to design, everyday – across all activities and all disciplines.

It is not an attempt to standardise exact processes – these must be flexible...

It is also not an attempt to standardise the software we use...

But in standardising the _data_ but not the data-_base_, we provide great opportunities for efficiencies, for collaboration and most of all, to change the way we work.


It is crafted as transdisciplinary, software-agnostic and office/region/country-invariant, and therefore would be nothing without our active community and wide range of contributors.

The whole **BHoM** project uses an open-source model for project architecture, co-creation and planning. So explore, experiment and contribute to both the source code and the wiki. Sharing and building our code together in this open-source type approach means we can feed off and pool our disparate knowledge, experience and expertise towards a common goal – better design.
