# Welcome to BHoM Wiki!

## So - what exactly is the BHoM?

The **BHoM** (**Buildings and Habitats object Model**) is a collaborative computational development project for the built environment. It is a collective effort to share code and standardise the data that we use to design, everyday – across all activities and all disciplines.

It is not an attempt to standardise exact processes – these must be flexible...

It is also not an attempt to standardise the software we use...

But in standardising the _data_ but not the data-_base_, we provide great opportunities for efficiencies, for collaboration and most of all, to change the way we work.


It is crafted as transdisciplinary, software-agnostic and office/region/country-invariant, and therefore would be nothing without our active community and wide range of contributors.

The whole **BHoM** project uses an open-source model for project architecture, co-creation and planning. So explore, experiment and contribute to both the source code and the wiki. Sharing and building our code together in this open-source type approach means we can feed off and pool our disparate knowledge, experience and expertise towards a common goal – better design.

There are many ways to contribute and get involved at different levels - see [Getting Started](#getting-started) below.


Also, as well as creating a common language of **BHoM** objects - the large number of repositories contain a variety of different plugins and code to operate on **BHoM** objects and link the **BHoM** with our favourite software and tools.
Much of the core code is written in C#. But we also have code in JavaScript, C++, Python and visual programming languages such as Grasshopper User Objects and Dynamo Custom Nodes all forming part of the **BHoM**.
