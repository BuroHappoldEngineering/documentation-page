# Create a new adapter in 10 minutes

An Adapter is the part of BHoM that enables connection to and from external software.

The Adapter is built on top of the other two main repos: [the oM](https://github.com/BHoM/documentation/wiki/BH.oM-%E2%80%90-Define-New-Objects) and [the Engine](https://github.com/BHoM/documentation/wiki/BH.Engine-%E2%80%90-Create-New-Algorithms).

Detailed information on how to develop and implement the different parts of an adapter are available in the _[introduction to the BHoM_Adapter](https://github.com/BHoM/documentation/wiki/Introduction-to-the-BHoM_Adapter)_ and following pages. 

This guide will focus on getting you started for development in less than 10 minutes! üöÄ
